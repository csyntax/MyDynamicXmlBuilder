            My name is Ivan Ivanov and I am responsible for this project.

            I work as a Junior Web Developer at Telerik using latest .NET and JavaScript
            technologies like ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, SQL Server, Entity Framework, AngularJS,
            jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, MongoDb, NodeJS, etc.

            Additionally I study at Telerik Academy.
            I am also a Telerik Solution Master for Web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ASP.NET and NodeJS

        <p>
            In my free time I tend to write quite a lot of codes,
            make open-source libraries like <strong>MyDynamicXmlBuilder</strong> and many more.
        </p>
        <p>
             I expect lots of other interesting packages to follow in the near future!
        </p>

            Oh, and I almost forgot... I like listening to heavy metal music and drinking!
